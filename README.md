# Staff-Distribution-Plan-for-The-Flu-Season
## Project Summary
A medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis, is in need of help to allocate workers/staff across the 50 states of the United States during the Influenza season (where more people than usual suffer from the flu). Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clincs need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The goal of this project is to determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state. 
## Key Questions
* Who does the vulnerable population consist of?
* What states have the highest vulnerable population?
* How many medical staff should be sent to each U.S. state and when?
* What are your recommendations?
## Systems Used
* **Microsoft Excel:** For cleaning and organizing the data.
* **Microsoft Word:** For comments on the project.
* **Tableau Public:** Platform used for creating and sharing data visualizations.
